# UI Challenge - Android

## Introduction
This repository holds a UI focussed interview project meant to be done by Android candidates interviewing for the Software Engineer, Android role to be completed in about an hour â€“ although we need to calibrate over time to see how feasible this is.

## The interview
The candidate will be sent the following spec and proposed architecture. As with anything, there are lots of ways to achieve the same thing so the candidate can be given the opportunity to do how he/she pleases. Just need to be told that the boilerplate code is set up for this setup so they will have less time to get to the meat of the layouting bit if they decide to do something radically different. In addition, this architecture matches what we have today implemented on a high level for the media picker of the Android (Spaces V2) app. So while it would be interesting to hear what and how they would do differently (if they would), they also most likely would need to work in this set up if they are assigned tickets that relate to the media picker.

In addition, the interview should get a [copy of the boilerplate code of the project](https://github.com/airtimemedia/uichallenge-android/tree/master/UIChallenge-Boilerplate).

## Things to cover
* Implementation of RecyclerView and RecyclerView.Adapter.
* Creating responsive layouts and use of modern ViewGroups such as ConstraintLayout.
* Communication between Fragment and parent Activity.
* Resourcefulness if given a challenge something they have not done before.
* Eye for detail: are they able to match the design?
